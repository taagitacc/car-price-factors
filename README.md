## Motivation
The price of cars vary a lot. So it is interesting to examine what could be the possible reasons for that variation without diving into deep technical topics, but only using a set of general features that can be found in the specification of each vehicle.

## Project overview
Thi project focuses on the statistical analysis of a dataset of about 32000 vehicles sold in tha USA in 2019. The data is taken from  https://www.kaggle.com/prassanth/new-cars-price-2019.
After a rough analysis of the influencing factors, a model was created with those. Using that model, one can estimate approximately what is the price of an ordinary middle class vehicle.

## Installation
Anaconda distribution for python version 3 is the only requirement, in order to run the playbook.

## Conclusion
The manufacturer of the vihicles in the price segment analyzed is not alone the only factor contributing to the price. It is more the comnbination of manufactorer and set of equipment or engine characteristics that determine the price.

## Acknowledgements
