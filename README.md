## Motivation
The price of cars vary a lot. So it is interesting to examine what could be the possible reasons for that variation without diving into deep technical topics, but only using a set of general basic features that can be found in the specification of every vehicle.

## Project overview
Thi project focuses on the statistical analysis of a dataset of about 11900 vehicles sold betwee 1990 to 2017. The data is taken from  https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset.<br/>
After a rough analysis of the influencing factors, a model was created with those. Using that model, one can estimate approximately what is the price of an ordinary middle class vehicle.

## Installation
Requirements:
- Anaconda distribution for python version 3 as an environment when running the notebook.
- pip package "beautifultable" (Installation is included in the notebook)

## Conclusion
The manufacturer of the vihicles in the price segment analyzed is not alone the only factor contributing to the price. It is more the comnbination of manufactorer and set of basic characteristics that determine the price.
